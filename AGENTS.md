# Repository Contribution Guidelines

- Follow PEP8 style for Python files.
- Keep `requirements.txt` with one dependency per line, no leading spaces.
- After editing Python code, run `python -m py_compile chat_bot.py` to ensure it compiles.
- Document significant changes in the `readme.md` when features are added.
